# Minimum Vertex Cover Problem Solver

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of three distinct algorithms - Branch and Bound, Heuristics Method with Approximation, and Local Search (using Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing) - to find the optimal solution to the classical NP-hard optimization problem, Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC).

## Problem Definition

The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem can be described as follows:

Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), a vertex cover V' of G is a subset of V such that for each edge uv âˆˆ E, either u or v (or both) are in V'. A minimum vertex cover is the vertex cover with the smallest size of |V'|.

## Implemented Algorithms

The project includes implementations for the following algorithms:

1. **Branch and Bound**
2. **Heuristics Method with Approximation**
3. **Local Search** (using Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing)

These algorithms are evaluated based on their execution time, the size of the returned vertex set, and their relative error.
